## What we found

In the beginning, we started by finding out which days people like to fly. by finding both the type of each airport and the overview

People prefer to fly on Mondays and the least on Saturdays, as evidenced by the number of flights per airline at each airport.

Later, we find out which airport has the most competition by comparing the number of flights per airline in each airport.

By analyzing flight data, it was determined that the LGA airport has the highest level of competition among airlines.

The top five most visited destinations from LGA are ATL, ORD, CLT, MIA, and DTW.

When comparing flights only to those five destinations, some airlines are seen to have fewer flights than others. This may be due to the popularity of certain routes.

The number of aircraft and seats per machine were also compared, but there was found to be little to no correlation.

Finally, the total number of flights was analyzed against average delay time and found to be directly related. Airlines with higher average delays have fewer flights, and conversely, airlines with more flights have lower average delays. However, the relationship between the number of flights and average birth rate was not observed.
